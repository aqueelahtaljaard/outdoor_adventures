        <h1>BEST FISHING SPOTS</h1>
        <h2>FRESHWATER FISHING</h2>
        <p>
          There are a variety of lakes, rivers and dams including peaceful fly fishing. It is often a good choice for beginners as well as anglers who prefer to catch and release. Species typically found in freshwater locations includes carp, trout and bass. Some of the freshwater fishing spots in Cape Town that you can consider include the following:
        </p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <h3>
              <a href="http://www.fishingadvisor.co.za/blog/fishing-brandvlei-dam/">Brandvlei Dam: carp and whitefish</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
              Fishing Brandvlei Dam (Lake Marais). Brandvlei Dam forms part of the Lower Brandvlei River. Close by the dam is Worcester in Western Cape.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a href="https://carpsa.co.za/rietvlei-dam-2/">Rietvlei: carp and Mozambique tilapia</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Probably the dam that can be the most rewarding and most unforgiving venue in Gauteng. Where you can be fortunate to land a 40+ lb carp or go home empty handed. Clean and clear snaggy waters with heaps of features to target, from the island where carp patrol constantly to drop offs all the way to the other side of the dam (if your bait boat is able to go the distance, no inflatables or boats allowed)</p>

            <h3>
              <a href="https://www.piscator.co.za/CPS2/stillwaters/lakenvlei/">Lakenvlei: rainbow trout</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Lakenvlei is the Cape Piscatorial Society’s primary stillwater venue. It is a large, 82 ha, dam in the heart of the Hex River catchment area. Lakenvlei offers members the opportunity to catch some large brown and rainbow trout, with fish over 5lbs being caught. Furthermore, it offers members the ability to fly fish from float tubes, non-motorised boats or by wading from the bank.</p>

            <h3>
              <a href="http://www.turtlesa.com/misverstanddam.html">Misverstand Dam: carp, largemouth and smallmouth black bass, and Mozambique tilapia</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Misverstand Dam is a boaters paradise and if one started counting would most probably find about a 100 fancy speedboats being stored there. Regular visitors to the dam have built what they call extended caravan sites for accommodation. Caravans have been parked on a site and instead of a tent a wooden tent has been built around the caravan so that it looks like a house. There are a number of streets of these caravan houses and they have some weird names. One is called six pack avenue obviously because of the partying that takes place there.
            </p>
          </ul>

          <hr></hr>
        <h2>SEA FISHING</h2>
        <p>
          At the sea, you have a few different choices. You can fish from the shore, on the rocks or from a designated fishing area. Depending on the location and your experience, this can be peaceful or downright terrifying. You can also try a deep sea charter to fish on the open water. Species found in deeper seas include tuna. Charters make for a very fun, rewarding day out but be aware, some tours can be extremely challenging… especially when fishing for large game fish! In shallower waters, steenbras is often found.
        </p>

        <h1>HIKING</h1>
        <h3>SKELETON GORGE</h3>
        <p>Known for its popularity among locals and tourists, Skeleton Gorge is a scenic trek not rivalled by many. Ideal in dry conditions, this hike is great for both the seasoned and novice hiker. During the summer months you’ll be able to get some shade along the Afromontane forest nearly all the way up Skeleton Gorge. Bear in mind that this hike can get quite strenuous so be prepared to really work those muscles, and take the necessary safety precautions.</p>
        <p>Number of routes: Two routes</p>
        <p>Difficulty: Moderate</p>

        <hr></hr>
        <h3>MAMRE NATURE GARDEN</h3>
        <p>Situated along the West Coast, in the little town of Mamre, this National Heritage Site has picnic spots, short trails and a 1.5-hour trail walk. The 254ha reserve has an abundance of vegetation and small animals such as caracals and various reptiles. Pack your picnic basket and make a day of it.</p>
        <p>Number of routes: Two routes</p>
        <p>Difficulty: Moderate</p>

        <hr></hr>
        <h3>MEADOWRIDGE COMMON</h3>
        <p>Situated in the heart of the Southern Suburbs of Cape Town, Meadowridge Common is a small protected area of about 8 hectares. The common boasts endangered fynbos, which is indigenous to Cape Town. During September and October you can expect gorgeous floral displays, as well as a number of insects, birds and amphibians – the endangered Cape Rain Frog has also been spotted here. The Common offers a relaxing environment suitable for anyone looking to just enjoy being outside.</p>
        <p>Number of routes: One route</p>
        <p>Difficulty: Easy </p>

        <hr></hr>
        <h3>LION’S HEAD</h3>
        <p>This short summit offers panoramic views of Cape Town and unbeatable sunsets. It’s a popular route to do on nights where there’s a full moon. If you’re relatively fit, you’ll find yourself at the top quite quickly, which is why it’s such a popular after-work hike. There’s a little bit of climbing involved, but there are handholds and chains to help you on your way up and down. You can also take the roundabout way, which skips the climbing part if you are walking with small children or dogs.</p>
        <p>Number of routes: Two routes</p>
        <p>Difficulty: Moderate</p>

      <div id="mountain_climbing">
        <h1>MOUNTAIN CLIMBING</h1>
        <h3>TABLE MOUNTAIN</h3>
        <p>Table Mountain offers rock climbers of all abilities world-class routes on high quality rock. The famous Mother City landmark itself offers inspiring traditional (“trad”) multi-pitch climbing and the surrounding crags of the Peninsula offers exceptional bolted sport climbing in scenic areas. The sport climbing is mostly single-pitch, but some multi-pitch routes are available. </p>

        <hr></hr>
        <h3>LIONS HEAD</h3>
        <p>There are two crags on Lion's Head, one is Granite and the other is Sandstone. The sandstone climbing is on the concentric rings of rock at the top of the mountain (the Lion's Head part), while the granite climbing is on the huge Huguenot Slab, a short distance above the houses of Fresnaye/Bantry Bay and facing the sea and Robben Island.</p>

        <hr></hr>
        <h3>SILVERMINE</h3>
        <p>Silvermine is probably the most popular climbing area on the Cape Peninsula with short walk-ins, good rock quality and many excellent routes. Silvermine has five different crags and over 80 routes with grades ranging from 13 to 28. The crags go into the shade in the early afternoon. The Lower Silvermine Crag has easy routes and is perfect for beginners, Blaze of Glory is a little harder, Silvermine Main Crag is a good all round crag and Fawlty Towers for some harder stuff. The most recent addition is Silverminor Crag.</p>

        <hr></hr>
        <h3>MUIZENBERG BUTTRESS</h3>
        <p>Many Multi Pitch Trad Routes (normally 4-5 pitches), Grades 14 - 23. 20 min walk up to crag. This is a multi pitch trad climbing area. The crag gets shade in the afternoon and is a good winter venue as it dries out quickly. There are excellent toprope problems above the tea cave.</p>
